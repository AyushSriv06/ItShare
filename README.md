## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites

* Go (1.16 or later) 🔧

### Steps

1. Clone the repository ⬇️

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AyushSriv06/ItShare.git

## 🎮 Usage

### Starting the Server 🖥️

```bash
# Start server on default port 8080
go run ./server/cmd --port 8080

# Start server on custom port
go run ./server/cmd --port 3000
```

### Connecting as a Client 📱

```bash
# Connect to local server with default port
go run ./client/cmd --server localhost:8080

# Connect to remote server
go run ./client/cmd --server 192.168.0.203:4000
```

The application will validate:

* Server availability before client connection attempts
* Port availability before starting a server
* Existence of shared folder paths

## 🏠 Room-Based Architecture

Rooms allow you to communicate and share files with a subset of connected users.

### How Rooms Work

1. **🌐 Global Discovery**: All connected users are visible via `/status` command
2. **🏠 Room Creation**: Any user can create a room and invite specific users
3. **💬 Room Chat**: Messages sent within a room are only visible to room participants
4. **📁 Room File Sharing**: File operations (send, lookup, download) work within room context
5. **🎯 Selective Communication**: Users can switch between rooms or communicate globally
